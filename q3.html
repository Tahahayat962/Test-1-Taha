    <header><h1><strong>Old Fashioned Typesetting</strong> compared to <strong>Desktop Publishing</strong>, <strong>html</strong>, <strong>css</strong>. What is the difference?</h1></header>
    <main>
        <section id="1"><h2>Desktop Publishing
        </h2>
    <p>Desktop publishing is much faster than old fashioned typewriting as it is easier due to keyboards and screens with visual aids and brightness. </p></section>
        <section id="2"><h2>html</h2>
        <p>Html is even more different as it allows you to alter more aspects of the said page and it is online concerning webpages not real paper.</p></section>
        <section id="3"><h2>css</h2>
        <p>Css is the furthest from it as it is a coding language and someone used to old fashioned typewriting would not understand it, it is also for back end editing not real paper.</p></section>
        <footer>In conclusion, all these newer methods are vastly different from <strong>old fashioned typesetting</strong>, one could say they iteratively built upon it but it is still a very marked and
            major difference.
