<header><h1>Writing in Google docs vs html, what's the difference?</h1></header>
<p>html allows lets you edit a webpage from the back end and control many stylistic elements about it but it requires some prior experience or knowledge</p>
<p>in the field. Google docs on the other hand lets you edit the page directly and also edit stylistic elements but doesn't give you as much control and</p>
<p>you only have a file and not a webpage at the end unlike html.</p>
